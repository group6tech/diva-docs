4. (Optional) In the **Description field**, type a description of the group.

5. Click **Create New User Group**.

6. Click the **Members** tab.

7. From the drop down menu, select the **user account** that you want to add to the group.

8. Click **+Add Member**

9. Do you want to add another user account to the group? If Yes, go to Step 7.
