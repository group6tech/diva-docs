When creating a Drive Set, the separator is the text which is inserted automatically at the start of the suffix for each drive type.

<p class="tip">
  <strong>Tip</strong>: Before DIVA v2.14.0 this was forced to be `_`. Since DIVA v2.14.0 this is now ` - ` by default, as spaces are now allowed in drive names.
</p>

## Set the drive set separator:

<ol>

  <li>On the Fusion menu, click <strong>System</strong>, then <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>

  <li>
    Under <strong>Drives</strong>, in the <strong>Drive Set Name Separator</strong> field, type the new separator.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: this cannot use any of the characters < > : " / \ | ? * </p>
  </li>

  <li>Click <strong>Save Settings</strong>.</li>

</ol>

If you [create a drive set](/v3/admin/create-drive-set.html) the new separator will appear at the start of each suffix.
