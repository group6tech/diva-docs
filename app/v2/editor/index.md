DIVA is a media server designed and built for editors to streamline, store, share and simplify your Avid Media Composer environment.

Spend more time editing, less time setting up, and collaborate on projects with ease.

As and editor you'll be using <strong>DIVA Client</strong> frequently.
This is an application which allows you to use the drives on the DIVA Nodes, and to share Avid Projects with other users.
