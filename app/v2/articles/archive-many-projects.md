Archiving a project creates a Zip file of all the Avid MediaComposer project files.
See more [about project archiving](/v2/articles/about-project-archiving.html).

Archiving many projects at once will create one Zip file per project.

## Archive one or more projects

<ol>

  <li>On the DIVA Fusion menu, click <strong>Projects</strong>.</li>

  <li>
    Use the checkboxes to select the projects to archive.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can use the search and filter tools on the left to find specific projects.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Click the <i class="fa fa-download"></i> <strong>Archive</strong> button below the list of projects.</li>

  <li>
    A confirmation is displayed, including a list of all projects to archive.    
    <p>You have the option to <strong>Archive</strong>, <strong>Archive &amp; Delete</strong>, or <strong>Cancel</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Archive</strong> only creates a zip archive of the project files.</p>
    <p><strong>Archive &amp; Delete</strong> also deletes the projects from the drive once the archive has been created.</p>
    <p><strong>Cancel</strong> closes the dialog.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Click one of the buttons to create the archive or close the dialog.</li>

</ol>
