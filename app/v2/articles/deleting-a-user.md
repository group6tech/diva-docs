Only delete a user account if you are certain it will no longer be needed. If it is possible that the user will require the account again, you can disable the user account for now.

		<p>Before deleting the user account, ensure all of the user's files that you want to keep have been moved to another user account. Deleting a user account automatically deletes the user's private projects and Avid media files. Their shared project files will be moved to Unprotected.</p>
