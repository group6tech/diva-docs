Only delete a user account if you are certain it will no longer be needed. If it is possible that the user will require the account again, you can [disable the user account](/v2/articles/disable-user.html) instead.

<p class="tip tip--warning">
  <strong>Warning</strong>:
  Before deleting the user account, ensure all of the user's files that you want to keep have been moved to another user account. Deleting a user account automatically deletes the user's private projects and Avid media files. Their shared project files will be moved to Unprotected.

### Before you begin

Before deleting a user account ensure:

  - the user is signed out of DIVA Client, and
  - the users media has been moved to another user.
