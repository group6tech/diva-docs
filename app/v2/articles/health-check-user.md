This process checks the selected users' details, e.g., password, for consistency across all DIVA nodes. Perform this health check whenever a user is having problems using DIVA Client.

### Before you begin

Before performing a health check on a user account, ensure:

  - the users whose accounts you want to perform a health check on, are signed out.

## Health check on a user account:

1. From DIVA Fusion's **Users** menu, click **Users**.

2. Select the relevant **user account**.

3. If the user is signed in (online), disconnect the user account by clicking the **Disconnect** button.

4. Click **Health Check**.
