While [setting a user's drive access](/v2/articles/set-user-drive-access.html), if you change a **Avid Media** drive from **Write** to **Read** or **Denied**, a pop-up will appear asking you to **Move Media**.

One option is to **Leave all in place**. This will leave any Avid MediaFiles as they were on the the drives, and you will have to manually manage them later.

Alternatively you can select what other user to move their media to for each drive they had access to.

To save time you can **select a user for all drives** using the first dropdown.
There is a chance however that not all the users listed have access to all the same drives as the user you are managing. If this is true, then you will need to manually select a user for those drives.

When you click **Move Media**, any drives which do not have a user selected will show a message indicating that you must make a selection before you can proceed.

You can also choose to leave media in place per drive before clicking **Move Media**.
