The most likely reason is that you have only been granted **read-only** access to the drive.
To be able to add, modify, or delete files on a drive you need **full** access.

You can check what access you have on a drive by [displaying the drives information](/v2/articles/displaying-a-drives-information-in-diva-client.html#access).

If you have **full** access, and it is a **Avid Media** drive, you can only modify or delete media you have ingested or created yourself within Avid Media Composer.
If you need to work with other user's media, check out [moving media between users](/v2/articles/moving-media-between-users.html).

If you have **full** access, and it is a **Avid Project** drive, you can only work with bins in your folder and **Unprotected**.
See [working with shared projects](/v2/articles/working-with-shared-avid-projects.html) for more information.
