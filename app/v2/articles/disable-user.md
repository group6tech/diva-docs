You may need to disable a user account to temporarily prevent their access to the system.
This is easier than deleting a user account, and easily reversed.

### Before you begin

Before disabling a user account, ensure they are signed out of DIVA Client.

## Disable a user

1. From DIVA Fusion's **Users** menu, click **Users**.

2. From the list, click the relevant **user account**.

3. Uncheck the **Enable User Account** option.

4. Click **Save User**.
