To use Avid Media Composer with DIVA, you need to enable the <strong>All Drives</strong> option.

<ol>
  <li>Open <strong>Media Composer</strong>.</li>
  <li>Open any local project. If you don't have one, create one - you can delete it when you're done.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, then <strong>Console</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <img src="/images/v2/avid-all-drives.png" alt="Type AllDrives into the console"/>
    Type <kbd>AllDrives</kbd> in the console, and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <img src="/images/v2/avid-all-drives-output.png" alt="All drives will be viewed as media drives"/>
    The console should output <strong>All drives will be viewed as media drives</strong>.
    <p class="text-muted">If it instead says <strong>Only true media drives will be viewed as media drives</strong>, enter <kbd>AllDrives</kbd> again.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
