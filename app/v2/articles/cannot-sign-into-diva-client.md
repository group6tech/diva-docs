Sometimes signing into DIVA Client just doesn't work.
Here are a couple of reasons why it may not have worked, and some possible solutions.


<div class="fault">
  <h3 class="fault__title"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i> Invalid username or password</h3>
  <div class="fault__body">
    <p>Either your username doesn't exist, or the password isn't correct.</p>
    <p>Check with your administrator what your correct username is, or ask them to reset your password.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="fault">
  <h3 class="fault__title"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i> Already signed in elsewhere</h3>
  <div class="fault__body">
    <p>For sharing media and projects to work without fault, DIVA only lets you sign into one computer at a time.</p>
    <p>
      If you receive this message, it should include the name of the computer where you are already signed in.
      Otherwise the administrator can look up where your user account is currently signed in.
      Go there and sign out, or sign in as a different user.
    </p>
    <p>If it's telling you the computer where you're signed in is the computer you're at now, wait a minute and try again.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="fault">
  <h3 class="fault__title"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i> The server did not return a response</h3>
  <div class="fault__body">
    <p>
      The configured server may be incorrect.
      Click <strong>Options</strong> and check the the <strong>Server</strong> value is either the <strong>hostname</strong> or <strong>IP address</strong> of the DIVA Server.
      You can check this by entering the hostname or IP address into an internet browser, and you should see the DIVA Dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're sure the server hostname or IP is correct, and you still cannot connect, then the server may be offline for some reason.
      Check with your administrator.
