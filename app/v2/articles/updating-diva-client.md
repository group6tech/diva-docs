If a new version of DIVA has been installed to DIVA Server then there's a chance you need to update DIVA Client too.
Don't worry, it's all pretty much automagical.

DIVA Client will pop-up a message if there's a new version ready to go.
If you get this message at the start of the day, then it's worth installing the update there and then.
Or if you're in the middle of editing, don't panic!
The update can wait until you're ready for it.
