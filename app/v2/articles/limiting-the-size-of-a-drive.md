Sometimes you may want to restrict the capacity of a drive.
The limit that you can set will depend on the size of the volume.

## To set a drive capacity quota

1. ![Navigate to Drives](/images/v2/drives/drives-menu.png)
	From DIVA Fusion's **Drives** menu, click **Drives**.
2. ![Select the drive](/images/v2/drives/drive-select.png)
	Locate and click the relevant drive.
3. ![Set the quota](/images/v2/drives/quota-slider.png)
	In the **Quota** field, overtype the existing value, and from the drop down menu, select the relevant units.
	Alternatively, you can use the slider to adjust the quota.
	<p class="text-muted">Note: Available units are GB (Gigabytes) and TB (Terabytes).</p>
4. ![Click Save Drive](/images/v2/drives/drive-save-btn.png)
	Click **Save Drive**.

<div class="note note--success">
	<h4 class="note__title"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> Result</h4>
	<p>Your changes to the quota are saved. The amount of free space is also updated to reflect the change in quota.</p>
</div>

<div class="note note--info">
	<h4 class="note__title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> What's next?</h4>
	<p>Check the <a href="/v2/articles/managing-the-job-queue.html">Job Queue</a> and ensure the new quota has been applied.</p>
	<p>Then mount the drive on a suite and check the free space matches the updated quota.</p>
</div>
