Favourites provide DIVA Client users with easy access to the drives they use most often. A favourite is a customised collection of DIVA drives that can be mounted in one go by the DIVA Client user. This saves users time because by using favourites, users don't have to locate and mount the drives they require one-by-one.

A favourite can be set up for:

- all DIVA Client users
- a particular group of users, e.g., a project team, or
- multiple groups of users.

The following picture describes the ticks and crosses on the Favourites page.
