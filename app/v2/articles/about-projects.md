With DIVA shared projects, a user can drag and drop bins within Avid Media Composer to:

  - hide the bins from other users by placing them at root level in Avid's file manager
  - provide other users with view-only access of the user's files by placing the bins in the user's own folder
  - access other users folders to open files as read-only files, and
  - using the unprotected folder, transfer bins to other users.
