Your DIVA license key is a USB dongle that is plugged into your server or main computer.

With your license key plugged in, you can:

- add volumes to the license pool
- remove volumes from the license pool
- add, modify and delete drives, and
- modify users' access (permissions) to drives.

Without your license key plugged in, you can't do any of the above. However, users can continue to use the current set of volumes and drives.
