Before Avid project drives can be added on a Avid DIVA volume, this process needs to be permitted. You can also prevent the addition of Avid Project Drives on an Avid DIVA volume.

Preventing the addition of Avid project drives on a Avid DIVA volume will not stop existing project drives from being used on that volume.

## Allow or disallow Avid Project drives on a volume

<ol>

  <li>On the Fusion menu, click <strong>Drives</strong>, then click <strong>Volumes</strong>.</li>

  <li>
    Under the <strong>Projects</strong> column, click the relevant volume's <i class="fa fa-times"></i> or <i class="fa fa-check"></i>.

    <p class="note">Note: Ticking the <i class="fa fa-check"></i> will display a <i class="fa fa-times"></i>, and the creation of projects will not be allowed on the volume.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
