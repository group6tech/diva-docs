Sharing a user's project with other users requires you to perform a range of tasks across DIVA Fusion (or DIVA Client) and Avid.

### Before you begin

Before sharing a new project, ensure:

  - a user has created a project in Avid Media Composer on the correct drive, and
  - the user has closed the project in Avid Media Composer.

## Share a project

<ol>

  <li>On the DIVA Fusion menu, click <strong>Projects</strong>.</li>

  <li>Click the relevant project's blue <i class="fa fa-share-square-o"></i> button.</li>

  <li>You will be asked to confirm that you want to share the project. Click <strong>Share</strong>.</li>

  <li>
    After a few moments the blue <i class="fa fa-share-square-o"></i> button should disappear next the project you just shared, and you should see a notification message such as:
    <p><img src="/images/v2/fusion/project-list-shared.png" alt="Project after sharing"/></p>
    <p>If it does not display within a minute or two, check to see if the relevant job has been run on the server.</p>
</ol>

<p class="tip tip--result">
  <strong>Result</strong>:
  The project is shared with all the users of the drive. A message is displayed confirming that the new shared project is available on the relevant volume.<br/>
  You can now open the project in Avid Media Composer.
</p>

<h2>Share multiple projects</h2>

You can also share more than one project at a time.

<ol>

  <li>On the DIVA Fusion menu, click <strong>Projects</strong>.</li>

  <li>Use the checkboxes to select the projects to share. You can use the filter and search tools on the left to help find the projects.</li>

  <li>Click the <i class="fa fa-share-square-o"></i> <strong>Share</strong> button below the project list.</li>

  <li>
    A dialog asks you to confirm that you want to share the selected projects.
    If any of the selected projects are already shared, they exluded from this list.
  </li>

  <li>Click the <i class="fa fa-share-square-o"></i> <strong>Share</strong> button in to share listed the projects.</li>
</ol>
