Sharing a project successfully requires you to perform a range of tasks across DIVA Client and Avid.

### Before you begin

Before sharing a new project, ensure:

- you are signed into DIVA Client
- the relevant project drive is mounted in DIVA Client, and
- Avid Media Composer is open and the Select Project window is displayed

## Share a new project:

<ol>

  <li>On Avid's Select Project window, click <strong>External</strong>.</li>

  <li>
    Click the <strong>folder icon</strong> and locate the relevant <strong>DIVA project drive</strong>.
    <p class="note">Note</strong>: Find the drive that was mounted in DIVA Client.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Click <strong>New Project</strong>.</li>

  <li>
    Complete the new project's settings.</li>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can provide the project with a meaningful name and adjust a range of settings, e.g., format, raster dimension and colour space.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    On Avid's New Project window, click <strong>OK</strong>.
    <p class="note"><strong>Important</strong>: Do not open the new project in Avid just yet. Opening the project in Avid prematurely may prevent the project from being shared.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Return to <strong>DIVA Client</strong>. A message is displayed at the bottom of the DIVA Client window informing you that DIVA has found the project.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This message is displayed at the bottom of the DIVA window. It may take a few moments for DIVA to discover the new project. Ensure this message is displayed before proceeding.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    On the DIVA Client menu, click <strong>Projects</strong>.
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/v2/client/projects-list-client-share.png" alt="List of projects"/>
      <figcaption>The new project is listed. It will be listed as a private project. The project will have a Share button.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>Click <strong>Share</strong> for your new project.</li>

  <li>
    The project is shared with all the users of the drive. The order in which projects are onscreen listed may change. A message is displayed at the bottom of the DIVA Client window confirming that the new shared project is available on the relevant volume.
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/v2/client/projects-list-client-share-done.png" alt="Project is shared"/>
      <figcaption>Ensure this message is displayed before proceeding. If it does not display within a minute or two, contact your DIVA Fusion administrator and ask if the relevant job has been run on the server.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>On Avid's Select Project window, select the <strong>new project</strong>, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p class="tip tip--result">
  <strong>Result</strong>:
  The project is opened in Avid Media Composer. The first bin and a range of folders is displayed.
</p>

### What's next?

The project is ready to use. You can use Avid's file manager to drag and drop bins from one folder to another. For more information, see [sharing bins in Avid Media Composer](/v2/articles/share-bins.html).
