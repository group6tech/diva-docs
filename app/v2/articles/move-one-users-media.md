### Before you begin

Before moving a users' media files to another user's account, ensure:

- there is at least one user account with write access to the media drive from which media will be moved, and
- for the user account to which the media will be moved, that this user account has read or write access.

<p class="tip tip--warning">
  <strong>Warning</strong>:
  Only move a user's media files when you are certain the user has no more use for them. All the user's media files on the selected drive will be moved and this cannot be undone.
</p>

## Move one users' media to one user account:

<ol>

  <li>From DIVA Fusion's <strong>Drives</strong> menu, click <strong>Drives</strong>.</li>

  <li>Locate and click the relevant <strong>media drive</strong>.</li>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If there are no user accounts with write access, the drop down menu and 'Move Media' button will not be displayed. In this case, you can either cancel the process or click 'Leave in Place', then grant the relevant user access, save your changes to the permissions, and try again.</p>
  </li>
