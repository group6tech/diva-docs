## Prevent other users from saving changes to your files

To prevent other users from modifying files in your bins, use Avid's file manager to move the bins to your folder. Your folder is named after your DIVA Client username.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>:
  Other users will be able to see and open the files in your folder, but will not be able to save any changes back to the bins in your folder.
</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>:
  Likewise, if another user moves their bins to their own folder, you will be able to open them, but won't be able to save changes back to the bins in their folders.
</p>

## Hiding your files from other users

You can hide your bins from other users by placing them at root level. At this level, your files will only be seen by you.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>:
  You cannot use DIVA Client to archive/export files that are stored at root level.
</p>

## Transferring files between users

Only use the Unprotected folder to swap files with other users. Ensure that files are not worked on while they are in the Unprotected folder. If someone places their files in the unprotected folder for you to work on, move the files from the unprotected folder and place them at root level or within your folder.

<p class="tip tip--warning">
  <strong>Working with unprotected files</strong><br/>
  Do not work with bins while they are in the Unprotected folder. Avid is not multi-user aware. While bins are in the Unprotected folder, other users can overwrite any changes you make and vice versa. Overwritten work cannot be recovered.
