When a node is added to DIVA, all of it's volumes are automatically monitored. This includes reporting of it goes offline, or is low on space.

There may be scenarios where you do not wish to monitor a particular volume. As new volumes are monitored by default, you can choose to disable monitoring per volume.

## Enable or disable monitoring on a volume

1. On DIVA Fusion's **Server** menu, click **Nodes**.

2. Click on the node which hosts the volume.

3. Click the **Volumes** tab.

4. Click the <i class="fa fa-wrench"></i> icon for the volume you wish you change the monitoring settings for.

5. If you wish to monitor the volume, ensure **Monitor** is checked.<br/>
  If you do not wish to be notified if the volume is offline, or low on space, ensure **Monitor** is not checked.

6. Click **Save changes**.
