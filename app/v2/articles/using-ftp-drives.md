FTP drives are not mounted as a local drive on your edit suite. Instead, an FTP drive is opened in a third party application.

When you open an FTP drive, the default FTP software on your computer is used to open the connection to the remote server.

If you do not have any specific FTP software installed on your computer, then the FTP server will likely open in your default internet browser. Unfortunately this does not allow you to upload.

If you wish to open FTP drives in a "real" FTP client, we recommend WinSCP for Windows, and Cyberduck for OS X.

  <strong>Note</strong>:
  FileZilla is not supported on either operating system, as it does handle ftp:// addresses automatically.
