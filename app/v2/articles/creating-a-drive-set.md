With DIVA Fusion, you can add a set of new drives consisting of all three drive types, and you can do this in one go.
This means you don't have to add the drives one-by-one.
All new drives in the set are automatically suffixed, making them easy to identify.
If you want to, you can modify the suffix to suit your drive naming conventions.
As part of the same process, you can assign drive access to your users.


## To add a drive set

1. ![Click Drives, then Drives](/images/v2/drives/drives-menu.png)
	From DIVA Fusion's **Drives** menu, click **Drives**.
2. ![Click New Drive Set](/images/v2/drives/set-new-btn.png)
	Click **New Drive Set**.
3. ![Enter the base name](/images/v2/drives/set-base-name.png)
	In the **Base Name** field, type the name that you want to see on all three drives.
	<p class="text-muted">Note: You can use uppercase and lowercase letters, numerals, dashes and underscores. Do not use slashes or any other special characters.</p>
4. ![Check Create Favourite](/images/v2/drives/set-create-favourite.png)
	Check **Create Favourite** to create a new Favourite containing the drives you're about to create.
5. ![Uncheck drives](/images/v2/drives/set-uncheck-drives.png)
	(Optional) Uncheck under **Create** the drive types you don't want to create.
6. ![Set the volumes](/images/v2/drives/set-volumes.png)
	Select the **Volume** where you want to create each drive type.
	<p class="text-muted">Note: Your drives don't all have to reside on the same volume. If you think the volume may have insufficient space for all the media files that will be created, select another volume.</p>
7. ![Set the suffix](/images/v2/drives/set-suffix.png)
	(Optional) Overtype each **Suffix** with the suffix you want to see on the drive name.
	<p class="text-muted">Note: Each drive name will consist of the base name and a suffix.</p>
8. ![Set user access](/images/v2/drives/set-permissions.png)
	For each user account (where relevant), select the relevant **Permissions**.
	<p class="text-muted">Note: To apply the same setting to all users in the list, click the column title (click Denied, click Read or click Write).</p>
9. ![Click Create Drive Set](/images/v2/drives/set-create-btn.png)
	Click **Create Drive Set**.
