To display a list of jobs, on DIVA Fusion's menu, **Server**, then click **Jobs**.

Here you will find jobs that:

<ul>

  <li>
    are queued and waiting to run
    <p class="note">Status = Queued</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    are currently running
    <p class="note">Status = Running</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    have been completed
    <p class="note">Status = Completed</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    have failed because of an error, and
    <p class="note">Status = Error</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    have been cancelled
    <p class="note">Status = Cancelled.</p>
  </li>

</ul>

## Filter the job list

If the list of jobs is too long and you are finding it difficult to locate a particular job or set of jobs, you can shorten the list using the filter options below.

Once you have located the jobs you are looking for, you can:

  - select one or more failed jobs (jobs with an error) and/or queued jobs, then click Cancel Selected to cancel the jobs.
  - select one or more failed jobs (jobs with an error) and/or cancelled jobs, then click Retry Selected to run them.
