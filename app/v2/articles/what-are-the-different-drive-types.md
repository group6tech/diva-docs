The image shows a volume (hard disk). In this example, the volume has been assigned to an Avid Pool and three drives have been set up; one of each type.

There are three types of drive:

- Basic
- Avid Media
- Avid Projects



## Basic Drives

Basic drives are designed to handle file-based media, but are great for anything which isn't a MXF or Avid Project.

You cannot create Avid MXF files on a Basic drive. Media Composer projects cannot be shared on a Basic drive.



## Avid Media Drives

Media drives are optimised exclusively for Avid MFX files. To share Avid MXF media files, the media has to be created on a Media drive.

Users can only save and work with Avid MXF files on this drive.



## Avid Project Drives

Project drives are optimised exclusively for Avid Media Composer projects and bins. To share an Avid project, it has to be created on a Project drive.
