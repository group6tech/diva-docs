Messages help you keep track of a range of background activities that are performed by the system, e.g.:

- drives that have been mounted by a user
- favourites that have been deleted by an administrator
- notices of impending server shutdowns by an administrator, and
- drives or nodes that have gone offline.

These messages appear in the footer of DIVA Client, or sometimes as a pop-up if the message is deemed important.

<div class="platform-win">
	<p>On Windows, you can view a log of all messages by clicking <strong>Messages</strong> on the DIVA Client menu.</p>
