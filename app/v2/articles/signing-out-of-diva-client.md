I thought post never stopped?

If you're done for the day, or just want to change to a different user, you need to sign out of DIVA Client.

Doing so will un-mount all drives you currently have mounted. It's safest to make sure that Avid Media Composer is closed before signing out of DIVA Client.

### To sign out of DIVA Client

{% include platform-switcher.html win=true mac=true %}

<div class="platform-mac">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <img src="/images/v2/mac/diva-client-sign-out-username.png" alt="Click your username" />
      Click your <strong>username</strong> in the top right corner of the DIVA Client window.
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="/images/v2/mac/diva-client-sign-out-button.png" alt="Click Sign out"/>
      Click <strong>Sign out</strong>.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="platform-win">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <img src="/images/v2/win/diva-client-sign-out-username.png" alt="Click your username" />
      Click your <strong>username</strong> in the top right corner of the DIVA Client window.
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="/images/v2/win/diva-client-sign-out-button.png" alt="Click Sign out"/>
      Click <strong>Sign out</strong>.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="note note--success">
  <h4 class="note__title"><i class="fa fa-bicycle"></i> Adiós</h4>
  <p>All your mounted drives are un-mounted, and you are returned to the sign in screen.</p>
  <p>You can close DIVA Client.</p>
</div>

<div class="note note--info note--collapse">
  <h4 class="note__title"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Tip</h4>
  <div class="note__body">
    <p>Closing DIVA Client will automatically un-mount your drives and sign you out. This is often faster than manually signing out as described above.</p>
    <p>Using the keyboard shortcuts <kbd>alt + f4</kbd> or <kbd>⌘ + q</kbd> to close DIVA Client has the same effect.</p>
  </div>
</div>
