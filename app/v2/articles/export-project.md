On Microsoft Windows, projects can be exported to an archive folder for archiving at the end of a project, or for back-up purposes. You can archive users' folders and unprotected folders. Bins at the root level are not archived.

### Before you begin

Before archiving an Avid project, ensure:

- DIVA Client is running and your are signed in, and
- the bins that you want to archive are not at root-level.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>:
  Ensure all bins to be archived are stored within users folders or the project's Unprotected folder.
</p>

## Export an Avid project

1. On the DIVA Client menu, click **Projects**.

2. Click the relevant project's <i class="fa fa-share-square-o"></i> <strong>Export</strong> button.

3. The **Browse for Folder** window is displayed. Locate the destination folder or make a new folder in a directory of your choice.

4. Click **OK**.

  <strong>Result</strong>:
  A message is displayed informing you that the project was saved to the designated folder.
</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>:
  The complete file path is specified in the message. The exported folder replicates the directory structure as seen in Avid, with copies of the project's files in copies of the users' folders. Any of the project's files that are at root level and in the Unprotected folder are also archived.
