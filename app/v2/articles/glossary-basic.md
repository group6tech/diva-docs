## <a name="drives"></a>Drives

The drives created for use in DIVA are where you save and work with your files.

If mounted on the computer that is being used and your user account has been granted full access to the drive, the drive is available to save and work on your files.

If your user account has only been granted read-only access to the drive, you can view files and copy files from the read-only drive to another drive.

There are three different [drive types](#drive-types), each designed to work with different types of files.



## <a name="drive-types"></a>Drive Types

There are three different types of drives:

- **Avid Media** for sharing Avid MXF files between users
- **Avid Projects** for sharing Avid projects and bins between users
- **Basic** for all other types of files.

See [What are the different Drive types?](/v2/articles/what-are-the-different-drive-types.html) for more information.



## <a name="favourites"></a>Favourites

Favourites provide you with easy access to the drives you use most often. A favourite is a customised grouping of drives. With a favourite, you can mount a set of drives in one go; you don't have to locate and mount drives one at a time.

Favourites can be made available to all DIVA Client users or a particular group of users.
