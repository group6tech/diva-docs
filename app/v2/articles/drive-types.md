The drives created for use in DIVA are where you save and work with your files. If mounted on the computer that is being used and your user account has been granted full access to the drive, the drive is available to save and work on your files. If your user account has been granted read-only access to the drive, you can view files and copy files from the read-only drive to another drive.

The following picture shows a hard disk (storage device),like the one in your computer or server. For example, a 40 TB disk that is using 40 TB of the Avid DIVA License. On this volume, three drives have been set up; one of each type.

There are three types of DIVA drive:

- Basic Drive
- Avid Media Drive
- Avid Projects Drive

If you have full access to a Basic drive, you can add files of any type.

If you have full access to an Avid Media drive, you can only save and work with Avid MXF files on this drive.

If you have full access to an Avid Projects drive, you can only save and work with Avid Media Composer projects and bins.

There are also external drives, which are not hosted on a node:

- FTP
- Network
