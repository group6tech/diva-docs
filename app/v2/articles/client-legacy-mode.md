As of DIVA 2.15.0, the macOS client supports two methods of mounting drives - AppleScript and Legacy.

AppleScript mounts drives in a faster and more reliable manner.
This is the new default method of mounting drives.

If, however, you are using [Network Drives](/v2/articles/about-client-drives.html), you may find that some drives do not mount on the desktop with the correct name.

If this occurs, you can change the mount method to Legacy.

### Before you begin

Before changing the drive mount method, ensure all drives are [unmounted](/v2/articles/unmount-drive.html).

## Change the drive mount method

1. Open **DIVA Client**.

2. Click **Options**.

3. Set **Drive Mount Method** to **AppleScript** or **Legacy**.

4. Click **Save**.
