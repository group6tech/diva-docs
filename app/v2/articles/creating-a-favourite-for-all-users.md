Setting up a favourite for all DIVA Client users to use is straight forward to do. Once set up, all DIVA Client Users will be able to use it to mount the drives that are assigned to it.

## To add a favourite for all users

1. ![Navigate to Favourites](/images/v2/favourites/favourites-menu.png)
	On DIVA Fusion's menu, click **Favourites**.
2. ![Click New Favourite](/images/v2/favourites/new-btn.png)
	Click **New Favourite**.
3. ![Name and description](/images/v2/favourites/new-name.png)
	Complete the **Name** field and if required, the **Description** field.
	<div class="text-muted">Note: Give the favourite a unique name, for example, a name that encapsulates the drive or drives that you will be giving everyone access to.</div>
	<div class="text-muted">Note: If providing a description, provide enough information to distinguish this favourite from any others.</div>
4. ![Check Enabled](/images/v2/favourites/new-enabled.png)
	Ensure **Enabled** is checked.
5. ![Check Shared](/images/v2/favourites/new-shared-checked.png)
	Ensure **Shared** is checked.
6. ![Click Save Favourite](/images/v2/favourites/new-save-btn.png)
	Click **Save Favourite**.
7. ![Click the Drives tab](/images/v2/favourites/new-drives-tab.png)
	Click the **Drives** tab.
8. ![Add a drive](/images/v2/favourites/new-drives-add.png)
	From the drop down menu, select a drive, then click **<i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add Drive**.
9. ![Assign a drive letter](/images/v2/favourites/new-drive-letter.png)
	(Optional) Assign a preferred drive letter to the drive.
	<div class="text-muted">This step is only relevant to Windows users. If you assign a preferred letter to the drive, then when users mount the drive, the preferred letter will be mapped to the drive. If the drive letter you selected for this drive is already mapped to a mounted drive, another letter will automatically be mapped to this drive.</div>
10. Repeat from step 8 to add more drives to the favourite.
