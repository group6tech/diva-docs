To use a drive, it has to be mounted on the computer you are using. On mounting the drive, it is assigned a drive letter (Windows Only). If you want to, you can select a letter that is not currently mapped to another mounted drive.

### Before you begin

Before mounting a drive, ensure the Drives pane is displayed. To do this, on the DIVA Client menu, click **Drives**.
