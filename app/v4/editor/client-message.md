With the messages page, you can keep track of range of background activities that are performed by the system, e.g.:

- drives that have been mounted by a user
- favourites that have been deleted by an administrator
- notices of impending server shutdowns by an administrator, and
- drives or nodes that have gone offline.

To display these messages, on the DIVA Client menu, click **Messages**.
