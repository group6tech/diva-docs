### Before you begin

Before mounting a set of drives with a favourite, ensure you are signed into DIVA Client.

  Loading a favourite might not actually mount any drives. You have to have access to each drive within a favourite for it to be mounted.
</p>

## Load a favourite

1. On the DIVA Client menu, click **Favourites**.

2. Click the relevant favourite's green <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> button.

<p class="tip tip--result">
  <strong>Result</strong>:
  The drives that have been assigned to the favourite, and that you have permission to see or use, are mounted.
</p>

Alternatively, you can click the favourite, then click the Load Favourite button.

### What's Next?

If you want to see which drives are mounted, on the DIVA Client menu, click Drives.
