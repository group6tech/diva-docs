We may occasionally ask you to enable betas on a specific computer. 
We don't recommend using this without contacting us first.

1. Click your **username** in the top right corner.

1. Click **Preferences**.

1. Under **Application**, click the **Enable betas** toggle.

  <strong>Result</strong>:
  Betas are now enabled. If there is one avaliable, it will automatically download and install next time you restart DIVA Client. 
  Alternatively you can force the install by clicking on the parachute icon in the top right corner and follow the on screen instructions.
