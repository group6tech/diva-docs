The Avid attic is a folder created by Avid Media Composer where it stores recent copies of bins from your projects.

On a [DIVAFS](/v3/editor/about-divafs.html) enabled Avid Project drive the attic is located in a folder called **Unity Attic** on the DIVA drive itself.

If working on a project on a legacy v2 Avid Projects drive, the attic files are stored in the following locations:

<dl>
  <dt>macOS</dt>
  <dd>/Volumes/Users/Shared/AvidMediaComposer/Avid Attic</dd>

  <dt>Windows</dt>
  <dd>C:\Program Files\Avid\Avid Application\Avid Attic</dd>
</dl>
