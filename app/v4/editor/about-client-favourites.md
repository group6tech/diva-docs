Favourites provide you with easy access to the drives you use most often. A favourite is a customised grouping of drives. With a favourite, you can mount a set of drives in one go; you don't have to locate and mount drives one at a time.

Favourites can be made available to all DIVA Client users or a particular group of users. To set up a favourite, see your administrator.
