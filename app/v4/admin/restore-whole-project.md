This will restore an entire project as a new one. Alternatively you can [restore one or more bins](/v3/admin/restore-project-bins.html) to a current project.

If the project has been deleted, see [restore a deleted project](/v3/admin/restore-deleted-project.html).
Or if the drive the project was on has been deleted, see [restore a project from a deleted drive](/v3/admin/restore-project-from-deleted-drive.html).

As you complete each step you will see a summary of the decisions you have made.
You can click **Cancel** at most steps to go back and adjust your decisions.

You first need to select the project which you want to restore.

</figure>

1. Select **Restore the whole project**.

1. Click **Continue**.



## 4. Rename the project

If the drive you are restoring the project to already has a project of the same name, you'll be prompted to give the project you are restoring a new name.

If there is no naming conflict, you will not see this step, and you can skip straight to [step 5](#step5).

By default *RESTORE* is appended to the project name.

  <img src="/images/v2/fusion/restore-set-project-name.png" alt="Set the project name" />
  <figcaption>Set a new name for the project you are restoring if there is a conflict.</figcaption>
</figure>

1. Type a new name for the project you are restoring.

1. Click **Continue**.

1. If that project name is already in use on the drive you will be prompted to change it again. Repeat step 4.1.

## 5. Share the project

You can choose to either **share** the project with all users on the restore drive, or keep it **private** and restore it to just one user.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/v2/fusion/restore-share.png" alt="Share the project" />
  <figcaption>Share the project or keep it private to a user.</figcaption>
</figure>

1. To give all users access to the project, select **Share the project**.

1. To give just one user access to the project, select **Keep private**.

1. Click **Continue**.

If you decided to **share** the project, continue with [step 6](#step6) below.

If you decided to keep the project **private**, continue to [step 8](#step8).



<a name="step6" class="anchor"></a>
## 6. Move bins to unprotected or users

You can choose to move every bin into **unprotected**, or allocate them to **specific users** based on what user had the bin before.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/v2/fusion/restore-unprotected-or-users.png" alt="Move the bins" />
  <figcaption>Either move all bins to <strong>unprotected</strong>, or give them to <strong>specific users</strong>.</figcaption>
</figure>

When moving all the bins to **unprotected**, they are restored to either a **private** or **shared** subfolder based on where they were before, and then in a folder of the original bin owners name.
Any original subfolder structure is also applied.

When moving the bins to specific users, shared bins are placed in the new owners shared folder, and private bins are placed in a private sub-folder which is created in the new users folder.

1. To move all bins into unprotected, select **Move to unprotected**.

2. Or to move bins to specific users, select **Leave with users**.

3. Click **Continue**.

If you are moving all the bins to **unprotected**, skip to [step 9](#step9).

If you are **leaving the bins with users**, continue with [step 7](#step7) below.



<a name="step7" class="anchor"></a>
## 7. Reassign bins to users

If some of the original users who had access to the project no longer exist, or don't have access to the drive where the project is being restored, you will be prompted to reassign the bins.

If you do not see the **Reassign bins** step, skip to [step 9](#step9).

<figure>
  <img src="/images/v2/fusion/restore-reassign-bins.png" alt="Reassign bins" />
  <figcaption>Set what users to move bins to.</figcaption>
</figure>

You are presented with a table of the original users who had access to the project.

1. For each original user, set what current user you want to assign their bins to. You can also choose to move a specific users bins to **unprotected**.

1. Click **Continue**.

Continue on to [step 9](#step9).



<a name="step8" class="anchor"></a>
## 8. Select the private user

If you are restoring the project privately to a user you need choose a user.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/v2/fusion/restore-private-user.png" alt="Select user" />
  <figcaption>Select a user to restore the project to.</figcaption>
</figure>

1. From the dropdown select the **user** to restore the project to.

1. Click **Continue**.
