### Status Graphs
The four circular graphs show the current status for Jobs, Nodes, Drives, and Events. Hovering over any graph will display a breakdown of what it represents, e.g. the number of jobs queued, failed, or completed. Clicking the graph title will take you to that management page within Fusion.

### Installers
Download links for the various applications for your current version of DIVA.

### Tools
Additional files which you want to make easily available to all users. These are stored in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Group 6 Technologies\DIVA Fusion\Installs\Tools`, and you can add any file to this folder.

### Volume Usage
Any DIVA Volume which is monitored will display it's usage statistics here. This is a quick method to gauge free space across multiple DIVA nodes.

You can change which volumes appear on the dashboard by [changing each volume's monitoring settings](/v4/admin/monitoring-volume.html).
