Avid Media Composer keeps all media in folders associated with the computer which created it.
See [about media management](/v3/admin/about-media-management.html) for further information.

It is possible to move all the media on a DIVAFS media type drive to one of the known computers running DIVA Client on your system.

## Move media to one computer:

1. On DIVA Fusion's menu, click **Drives**.

1. Locate and click on the relevant **Drive**.

1. Click the **Usage** tab.

1. Click **Move Media**.

1. Select the name of the computer you want to move all the media to. This list is populated from all the computers which have recently connected using DIVA Client.

1. Optionally check the **Delete databases** button if you wish to force Avid Media Composer to rescan all the media.

1. Click **Move Media**.

You can check the Job Queue to view the progress of moving the media.
