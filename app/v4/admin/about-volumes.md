A node consists of one or more volumes. A computer or server that contains one or more storage devices, is an example of a node. A hard disk (storage device) is an example of a volume. If a volume is assigned to a DIVA License, the volume is known as a DIVA Volume.

The following diagram shows how volumes from different nodes can be assigned to a license.
