If, for example, you need to reboot a node, or the user is signed in from an unknown location, you can force the user's user account to sign out of DIVA client.

  <strong>Warning</strong>:
  Only force a user to sign out of DIVA Client as a last resort. When forcing the user to sign out, the drives will be unmounted and data loss may occur.

### Before you begin

2. From the list of user accounts, **check** the user(s) you want to disconnect.

3. Click **Disconnect**.
