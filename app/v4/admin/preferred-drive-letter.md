It's possible to set a preferred letter for a drive for when Windows users mount a drive, and the user has not specifically selected a drive letter to use.

For example you may want to set a Project type drive so that it always mounts as Z:\, if that is available on the edit suite at the time.

[Favourites](/v4/admin/add-drive-to-favourite.html) can still override this, and the user has the final say when mounting the drive.

## Set a drive's preferred letter

1. On DIVA Fusionâ€™s menu, click **Drives**.

1. Locate and click the relevant **drive**.

1. From the **Preferred Letter** drop down, select the drive letter you want to set as the preferred letter.

1. Click **Save Drive**.

  <strong>Result</strong>: When a user mounts the drive, and they have not specified what letter to use, and the preferred letter is available, it will mount as that letter.
