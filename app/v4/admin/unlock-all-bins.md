When using [bin locking](/v4/editor/locking-and-unlocking-bins.html) on a DIVAFS enabled Avid Projects drive, there are situations where bins may remain locked, perhaps due to a Media Composer crash for example.

You can quickly unlock all bins in a project if required.

<p class="tip tip--warning">
  <strong>Warning</strong> Check that users do not actually have bins open and locked in the project before unlocking all bins.
</p>

## Unlock all bins in a project

1. On the DIVA Fusion menu, click **Projects**.

1. Locate the project you want to unlock all bins for.

1. Click the **Tools** button for the relevant project.

1. Click **Unlock Bins**.

A [job](/v4/admin/about-jobs.html) will be created to unlock the bins in the project.

  <strong>Tip</strong> You can use the checkboxes to select multiple projects then click the <strong>Unlock Bins</strong> button below the project list to unlock the bins on all the selected projects.
