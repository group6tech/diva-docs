There are a couple of ways to restore your project files.

You can [restore an entire project](/v4/admin/restore-whole-project.html) which still exists, in which case a copy of the project will be made.

Or you can [restore one or more project bins](/v4/admin/restore-project-bins.html) back into the same project which still exists.

You can also [restore a deleted project](/v4/admin/restore-deleted-project.html), or a [project from a deleted drive](/v4/admin/restore-project-from-deleted-drive.html).
