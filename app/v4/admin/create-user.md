When adding a DIVA user account, you can grant the user access to one or both of the following:

  - DIVA Client
  - DIVA Fusion

### Before you begin

Before adding a user account, ensure:

  - you have the user's first name and last name
  - the user has chosen or been assigned a user name for the user account, and
  - (optional) you have the user's email address.

## Create a user

<ol>

  <li>On DIVA Fusion's menu, click <strong>Users</strong>.</li>

  <li>Click <strong>New User</strong>.</li>

  <li>
    Complete all relevant user fields and options.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The fields marked with a red asterisk are mandatory.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Click <strong>Save User</strong>.</li>
